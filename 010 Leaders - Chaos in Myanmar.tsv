0	6000	Leaders
6000	9000	Chaos in Myanmar
9000	13000	Asia's next failed state
13000	19000	Myanmar will become a Burmese blaze unless its neighbours adopt a more constructive stance.
19000	24000	When the generals who run Myanmar drew up a constitution to pave the way for an elected government
24000	31000	albeit one that would have no authority over the army, they termed the arrangement discipline flourishing democracy.
31000	37000	Untrammeled political competition they suggested would lead to disorder and impede development.
37000	40000	Only the army could ensure order and prosperity.
40000	46000	So it's ironic that since the army took complete control of the country again in a coup on February 1st
46000	50000	the only thing that has flourished is chaos.
50000	58000	Daily protests are a rejection of the push, although these have shrunk since the army began shooting unarmed demonstrators.
58000	63000	Soldiers are rampaging through rebellious districts, beating and killing at random
63000	72000	and reportedly charging grieving relatives 120,000 kuyat, that's $85, to release the bodies.
72000	78000	Citizens have burned down shops tied to the army. A general strike has paralysed businesses.
78000	81000	Public services have largely ceased.
81000	87000	In the borderlands some of the 20 or so armed groups that have battled the government on and off for decades
87000	93000	are taking advantage of the crisis to seize military outposts or caches of weapons.
93000	99000	The army has bombed them, sending refugees into neighbouring countries.
99000	103000	In short Myanmar is becoming a failed state.
103000	111000	A vacuum is being created in a territory bigger than France that abuts Asia's biggest powers, China and India.
111000	114000	It will be filled by violence and suffering.
114000	120000	Although Myanmar is not yet as lawless as Afghanistan, it's rapidly heading in that direction
120000	125000	a sobering warning of how hard it is to put a country back together.
125000	130000	The ruin of Myanmar is not only a calamity for the 54 million Burmese
130000	134000	it also creates risks that could ripple through the region.
134000	141000	Myanmar's guerrilla-controlled enclaves produce heroin and are the world's biggest suppliers of methamphetamine.
141000	144000	The country also exports misery.
144000	149000	Nine refugee camps over the border in Thailand are filled with victims of the fighting
149000	156000	between the army and ethnically based insurgents such as the Karen National Liberation Army or the KNLA.
156000	165000	Over 700,000 Rohingyas, a Muslim minority, fled to Bangladesh from a pogrom led by the army in 2017.
165000	168000	A newer export is disease.
168000	176000	China last month sealed off Ruoli, a border town, after three Burmese visitors tested positive for Covid-19.
176000	180000	These problems will get worse before they get better.
180000	185000	The army looks as if it means to hack and blast the protesters into submission.
185000	190000	It's warned them that they risk being shot in the head and the back, as many have been.
190000	193000	The known death toll exceeds 700.
193000	199000	On April 9th the army gunned down more than 80 people in the provincial city of Bagoe.
199000	203000	The protesters are using makeshift weapons to fight back.
203000	207000	Some are seeking military training from the rebel militias on the border.
207000	213000	In a country awash with arms, that's a recipe for shedding a lot more blood.
213000	219000	A group of elected lawmakers who've managed to escape arrest are talking about forming a federal army,
219000	223000	presumably encompassing some of the main ethnic militias.
223000	231000	The biggest of these can muster 20,000 soldiers equipped with anti-aircraft missiles, artillery and armoured personnel carriers.
231000	238000	The rebels, even were they to act in concert, don't have the firepower to overthrow the army and reverse the coup,
238000	243000	but neither has the army been able to defeat them, despite decades of trying.
243000	251000	The KNLA has been battling the army since 1949, making its campaign the world's longest-running civil war.
251000	256000	The army may eventually manage to assert its authority over the centre of the country,
256000	260000	inhabited by the Bama, the majority ethnic group.
260000	263000	But the apparatus of the state will be broken.
263000	268000	Tax collectors, teachers and doctors have walked off the job in droves.
268000	272000	When banks reopen, they're bound to suffer runs.
272000	278000	Foreign donors have frozen aid and foreign firms have suspended investments.
278000	284000	Before the coup, the World Bank had predicted that the economy would grow by almost six per cent this year.
284000	292000	Now it expects to shrink by ten per cent. Others warn of a contraction of twenty per cent.
292000	294000	Neighboring countries are alarmed.
294000	298000	China wants to keep out COVID-19 and protect strategic investments,
298000	304000	such as the pipelines that carry oil and gas from the Bay of Bengal to its interior.
304000	308000	India has been bridling at the flow of refugees from the fighting,
308000	313000	trying to turn them away and then reluctantly agreeing to admit them.
313000	319000	Some members of the normally hands-off ASEAN, a club of south-east Asian countries that includes Myanmar,
319000	323000	want to convene a summit to discuss the turmoil.
323000	325000	Then there's meddling from afar.
325000	331000	Russia, doubtless sensing an opportunity to needle the West, has backed the generals,
331000	335000	sending its Deputy Defence Minister to glad hand them.
335000	341000	America and Britain have imposed targeted sanctions on senior generals and the firms they control.
341000	345000	Such measures, though welcome, will not be decisive.
345000	350000	During earlier periods of military rule, Western pressure had little effect on previous junters.
350000	355000	The only outsiders able to influence the generals are Myanmar's close neighbours,
355000	361000	China, India and the other ASEAN countries, to whom they'll turn if shunned by the West.
361000	365000	The problem is that all these countries have stood back.
365000	369000	Beyond airing concerns about refugees or the coronavirus,
369000	374000	they tend to play down the havoc as an internal political affair.
374000	377000	That is short-sighted.
377000	382000	Letting Myanmar slide into mayhem will cause misery to ordinary Burmese
382000	387000	and threaten neighbours with drugs, refugees and instability.
387000	392000	To avoid that, those neighbours should adopt a braver, more constructive approach.
392000	395000	No country should recognise the coup.
395000	400000	More should impose sanctions on the top brass and their rent-seeking businesses.
400000	403000	ASEAN should suspend Myanmar's membership.
403000	406000	An arms embargo should be imposed.
406000	410000	China, India and Russia are currently the biggest suppliers.
410000	414000	Outsiders should press the army to release political prisoners,
414000	417000	including Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader they overthrew,
417000	422000	and start talking to her shadow government, operating near the Thai border.
422000	425000	The Thai government should turn a blind eye to the informal channels
425000	428000	by which it gets money and supplies.
428000	433000	Only concerted pressure can get the generals to talk to the civilians
433000	437000	and thereby put Myanmar onto a less ruinous path.
437000	441000	The alternative is a failed state at the heart of Asia.
