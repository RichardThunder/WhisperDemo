1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Leaders

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Chaos in Myanmar

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Asia's next failed state

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Myanmar will become a Burmese blaze unless its neighbours adopt a more constructive stance.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,000
When the generals who run Myanmar drew up a constitution to pave the way for an elected government

6
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,000
albeit one that would have no authority over the army, they termed the arrangement discipline flourishing democracy.

7
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Untrammeled political competition they suggested would lead to disorder and impede development.

8
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Only the army could ensure order and prosperity.

9
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,000
So it's ironic that since the army took complete control of the country again in a coup on February 1st

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
the only thing that has flourished is chaos.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Daily protests are a rejection of the push, although these have shrunk since the army began shooting unarmed demonstrators.

12
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,000
Soldiers are rampaging through rebellious districts, beating and killing at random

13
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and reportedly charging grieving relatives 120,000 kuyat, that's $85, to release the bodies.

14
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Citizens have burned down shops tied to the army. A general strike has paralysed businesses.

15
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Public services have largely ceased.

16
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,000
In the borderlands some of the 20 or so armed groups that have battled the government on and off for decades

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
are taking advantage of the crisis to seize military outposts or caches of weapons.

18
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The army has bombed them, sending refugees into neighbouring countries.

19
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
In short Myanmar is becoming a failed state.

20
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:51,000
A vacuum is being created in a territory bigger than France that abuts Asia's biggest powers, China and India.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It will be filled by violence and suffering.

22
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Although Myanmar is not yet as lawless as Afghanistan, it's rapidly heading in that direction

23
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
a sobering warning of how hard it is to put a country back together.

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The ruin of Myanmar is not only a calamity for the 54 million Burmese

25
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,000
it also creates risks that could ripple through the region.

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:21,000
Myanmar's guerrilla-controlled enclaves produce heroin and are the world's biggest suppliers of methamphetamine.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The country also exports misery.

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Nine refugee camps over the border in Thailand are filled with victims of the fighting

29
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,000
between the army and ethnically based insurgents such as the Karen National Liberation Army or the KNLA.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Over 700,000 Rohingyas, a Muslim minority, fled to Bangladesh from a pogrom led by the army in 2017.

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
A newer export is disease.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,000
China last month sealed off Ruoli, a border town, after three Burmese visitors tested positive for Covid-19.

33
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
These problems will get worse before they get better.

34
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,000
The army looks as if it means to hack and blast the protesters into submission.

35
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's warned them that they risk being shot in the head and the back, as many have been.

36
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
The known death toll exceeds 700.

37
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:19,000
On April 9th the army gunned down more than 80 people in the provincial city of Bagoe.

38
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
The protesters are using makeshift weapons to fight back.

39
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Some are seeking military training from the rebel militias on the border.

40
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:33,000
In a country awash with arms, that's a recipe for shedding a lot more blood.

41
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,000
A group of elected lawmakers who've managed to escape arrest are talking about forming a federal army,

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,000
presumably encompassing some of the main ethnic militias.

43
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:51,000
The biggest of these can muster 20,000 soldiers equipped with anti-aircraft missiles, artillery and armoured personnel carriers.

44
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The rebels, even were they to act in concert, don't have the firepower to overthrow the army and reverse the coup,

45
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,000
but neither has the army been able to defeat them, despite decades of trying.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The KNLA has been battling the army since 1949, making its campaign the world's longest-running civil war.

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:16,000
The army may eventually manage to assert its authority over the centre of the country,

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
inhabited by the Bama, the majority ethnic group.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
But the apparatus of the state will be broken.

50
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Tax collectors, teachers and doctors have walked off the job in droves.

51
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
When banks reopen, they're bound to suffer runs.

52
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Foreign donors have frozen aid and foreign firms have suspended investments.

53
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Before the coup, the World Bank had predicted that the economy would grow by almost six per cent this year.

54
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Now it expects to shrink by ten per cent. Others warn of a contraction of twenty per cent.

55
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Neighboring countries are alarmed.

56
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
China wants to keep out COVID-19 and protect strategic investments,

57
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,000
such as the pipelines that carry oil and gas from the Bay of Bengal to its interior.

58
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,000
India has been bridling at the flow of refugees from the fighting,

59
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,000
trying to turn them away and then reluctantly agreeing to admit them.

60
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Some members of the normally hands-off ASEAN, a club of south-east Asian countries that includes Myanmar,

61
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,000
want to convene a summit to discuss the turmoil.

62
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Then there's meddling from afar.

63
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Russia, doubtless sensing an opportunity to needle the West, has backed the generals,

64
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:35,000
sending its Deputy Defence Minister to glad hand them.

65
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,000
America and Britain have imposed targeted sanctions on senior generals and the firms they control.

66
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Such measures, though welcome, will not be decisive.

67
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,000
During earlier periods of military rule, Western pressure had little effect on previous junters.

68
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,000
The only outsiders able to influence the generals are Myanmar's close neighbours,

69
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,000
China, India and the other ASEAN countries, to whom they'll turn if shunned by the West.

70
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
The problem is that all these countries have stood back.

71
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Beyond airing concerns about refugees or the coronavirus,

72
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:14,000
they tend to play down the havoc as an internal political affair.

73
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,000
That is short-sighted.

74
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Letting Myanmar slide into mayhem will cause misery to ordinary Burmese

75
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,000
and threaten neighbours with drugs, refugees and instability.

76
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,000
To avoid that, those neighbours should adopt a braver, more constructive approach.

77
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,000
No country should recognise the coup.

78
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,000
More should impose sanctions on the top brass and their rent-seeking businesses.

79
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
ASEAN should suspend Myanmar's membership.

80
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,000
An arms embargo should be imposed.

81
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,000
China, India and Russia are currently the biggest suppliers.

82
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Outsiders should press the army to release political prisoners,

83
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
including Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader they overthrew,

84
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and start talking to her shadow government, operating near the Thai border.

85
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
The Thai government should turn a blind eye to the informal channels

86
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
by which it gets money and supplies.

87
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Only concerted pressure can get the generals to talk to the civilians

88
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,000
and thereby put Myanmar onto a less ruinous path.

89
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
The alternative is a failed state at the heart of Asia.
